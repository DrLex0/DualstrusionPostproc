**Describe the bug**

A clear and concise description of what the bug is.

**Environment**

* Your OS and the version of PrusaSlicer the issue is encountered with.
  Mind that bugs with alpha releases of PrusaSlicer should probably not be filed. Wait at least until the next beta release.
* Also mention the version of the script itself.
  This is just for bookkeeping because if it isn't the latest version, the first reply you will get will be a request to try it with the current script.
* The version of your Perl runtime (try `perl --version`), and of your GPX binary (try `gpx -?`).

**To Reproduce**

Please attach project file (3MF) and if possible, a ZIP with both the final .gcode and .x3g files.
If specific steps are required to reproduce the behavior, list them here.
